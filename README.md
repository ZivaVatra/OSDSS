Open Source Deep Sky Stacker

## Intro

So, back in 2012 I started work on an open source deep sky stacker. You can see the details (with example images) on the page here: http://www.ziva-vatra.com/index.php?aid=67&id=U29mdHdhcmU=


However dev stalled when I had to move to the city for work (the light pollution is so awful here that there is nothing to see at night but the moon and orange haze :-(  ).
Rather than write my own image processing program, this is a wrapper script around other tools.

Which other tools I will have to double check, which I will do once I put the code up here.

## Does it work

Yep! No idea how it compares to commercial/freeware stackers, but for a first attempt it was pretty good IMO. Direct link below, or just go to the page linked above.
