Open Source Deep Sky Stacker

## Intro

So, back in 2012 I started work on an open source deep sky stacker. You can see the details (with example images) on the page here: http://www.ziva-vatra.com/index.php?aid=67&id=U29mdHdhcmU=


However dev stalled when I had to move to the city for work (the light pollution is so awful here that there is nothing to see at night but the moon and orange haze :-(  ).

## Goals
At this point, I am just investigating which method is best for deep sky stacking, as a result I will add scripts and snippets to this repo as work progresses. I don't think I am even near an alpha quality piece of software, but you got to start somewhere :-)



Current versions:
	- deepsky_stack_vers1.sh --  Bash script that (ab)uses panotools/enfuse/nona from the hugin project to align and fuse images together. 
See http://www.ziva-vatra.com/image.php?render=67&name=U2lkZV9ieV9zaWRl for an example of 12 images stacked together using this script.
